Mavirk It's a graphical tool that helps you download videos and your favorite video and audio playlists, always getting the best results you are available. This project revolves around the YT-DLP project, so I can't guarantee that no failures occur, however, if something does not happen in the expected way you can notify me by opening a Issue.

- INSTALLATION
    - Download the library: libgtk-3-dev
    - Use the terminal to perform a "git clone" for this repository or download the folder here.
    - Be sure to have the Perl language.
    - Run the "Perl Main.pl" command and will be executed.
- IMPORT DEPENDENCIES FOR THE OPERATION
    - If you do not have **yt-dlp** and **FFmpeg** installed, then do it, and move **yt-dlp** to/usr/local/bin/, with execution permission.

## How to use
After opening the application just select the folder in which you want your media to be saved, enter the URL, choose the format and click Download. If a problem occurs again if the facilities are installed correctly, both GTK and YT-DLP and FFmpeg check everything. If you don't work yet you can open an issue by reporting the problem from the beginning (Issues related to complaint that is not working will not be considered if it is not explained to step-by-step until what led to error and without attempts by the user ).

After clicking downloading the process will start and you will only have to wait, if everything happens well a dialog box will report that everything is ready and you can already access your file.


### Important
Always run the Mavirk inside the folder you downloaded to make everything happen the right way. One of the problems that can happen if you don't do it is that you can't open the program because of the icon (including a charm to the program, so please don't do it
